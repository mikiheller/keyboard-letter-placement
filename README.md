# Letter Explorer 🎮

A simple, beautiful typing game designed for young children learning the alphabet and keyboard.

## How It Works

1. **A letter appears** at the top of the screen with a picture and word (e.g., "A" with an 🍎 Apple)
2. **The app speaks** the letter name, word, and phonetic sound ("A, Apple, ah")
3. **The keyboard highlights** the correct key with a glowing yellow effect
4. **Press the key** (on-screen or physical keyboard) and get a celebration! 🎉
5. **Repeat** with a new random letter
